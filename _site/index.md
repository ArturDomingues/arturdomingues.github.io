## Bio

I am a physicist with a BSc and MSc in Theoretical and Experimental Physics from IFSC–USP. My research focuses on quantum control of solid-state spin systems, particularly NV centers in diamond, integrating optimal control theory, numerical simulation, and machine learning techniques.

My work explores:
- Optimal control of open quantum systems  
- Machine learning strategies for quantum technologies  
- Simulation of NV center spin dynamics  
- Thermodynamic aspects of quantum mechanics

### Research Code

**NV Optical Simulation – Dynamic Baseline (MSc Project Repository)**  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ArturDomingues/nv-optical-sim-dyn-baseline)

This repository contains the simulation framework developed during my master's research. The codebase is currently being refactored and reorganized for clarity, modularity, and reproducibility. A structured and documented version will be released in the coming months.
